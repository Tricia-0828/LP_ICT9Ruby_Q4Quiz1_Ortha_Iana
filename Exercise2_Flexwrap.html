			<h2>Why Do I Like Math?</h2>
			<p>I like math because I get to play around with numbers. It also does not require much memorization compared to other subjects. In subjects like History, there are a lot of figures and dates to memorize, while in math all I have to do is memorize a simple formula and apply it to any given mathematical expression.</p>

			<h2>Why Do I Like Ballet?</h2>
			<p>Dance is more than just a hobby. I love it because dancing helps relieve tension in my mind; it is very relaxing. Especially after a long day of school, I would do random dance moves in my house because my body just wants to get rid of tension.</p>
